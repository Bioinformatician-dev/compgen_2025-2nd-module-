Here is the link to the datasets and scripts that we gonna use throughout Module 2:

If you are using either your own computer, the docker container or the rolv platform, you may need to download the zip file above and unzip it. You can use the terminal in Rstudio to do this:

```
wget http://bimsbstatic.mdc-berlin.de/landthaler/VoltRon/workshop.zip
unzip workshop.zip
```

If you haven't already installed R dependancy packages and VoltRon, go here to find more information below:

NOTE: You may need to install all R dependancies listed before you install VoltRon for safely using the ondisk operations that we gonna incorporate in the Module.
