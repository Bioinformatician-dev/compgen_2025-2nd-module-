# compgen_2025-2nd-module-
Spatial Omics Analysis

## Learning objectives and course plan for compgen2025 course 
Basic knowledge of R, Python, omics technologies, and statistics is expected from participants who who want to join all three modules. Participants who want to only join module 1 do not need to have programming experience but it would help if they know a bit of R. The application form has questions specific to these areas. However, we will adjust the level of the course content and the difficulty depending on the level of people selected for the course. 

Course url: https://compgen.mdc-berlin.de/ 
Organizer: Altuna Akalin (https://bioinformatics.mdc-berlin.de/)

## Prerequisites 
Programming with R (Module 2)
Programming with Python (Module 3)
Understanding of the basic probability and statistics concepts 
Conceptual understanding of high-throughput assays (sequencing, microarrays etc.) in genomics 

## Module 2: Spatial omics data analysis (Week 2: Starts on March 3rd)
Pre-requisite: R knowledge and background in spatial omics
Mastering the core spatial omics data structures and workflows
Executing image registration and spatial integration across multiple modalities
Performing advanced spatial analyses and niche clustering for biological Insights
The tool we will mostly use is https://bioinformatics.mdc-berlin.de/VoltRon/ 

## Course Plan
We ((https://bioinformatics.mdc-berlin.de/) will be using a virtual classroom to communicate with students. This classroom will also enable students to ask questions, and submit quizzes, and exercises. The details of this infrastructure will be shared with the accepted candidates. It will be “google classroom” [https://classroom.google.com/]. It is important you sign up in the classroom using your real names and not nicknames. If you have privacy concerns about google, create a temporary google account for this purpose only. 

Participants will work through the lectures and exercises at their own pace within the week dedicated to that module. There will be a hard deadline to submit quizzes and exercises by the end of the week for each module. There will be opportunities to interact with the instructors and other participants via the online platform. 

Although each module can be finished within a day if the participants dedicate a full day, we provide a week for completion of each module. This way, students can work at their own pace. A module consists of 1-2 hours of lectures, a quiz and programming exercises. The participants will need to dedicate between 8 to 20 hours per module depending on their previous experience with the topics.
